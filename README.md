Here you can go ahead and fiddle around with the source, make a fork and create a worse attempt at copying Nintendo.
I'm not selling anything at all, go ahead. This is afterall a fork of Ross 'Super Mario 64' remake, just with more dank memes.

However due to the GPL rule, you must credit back and publish the source as well if you're gonna fork this. Github does it automatically for you though.
